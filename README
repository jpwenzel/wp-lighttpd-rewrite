Rewrite rules for a Wordpress 2.x installation on top of a lighttpd web server

Written by Giovanni Intini, Jean Pierre Wenzel <jpwenzel@gmx.net>

This file comes in very handy if your using the following Wordpress Plugins:
* wp-super-cache (http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-super-cache/)
* WP-touch (http://bravenewcode.com/wptouch)

Usually, the mobile devices get the cached version of your Wordpress site served
instead of the WP-touch UI version. This script allows you to serve uncached 
files to mobile devices, search engine bots, etc. while serving cached (and 
possibly even compressed) content to "regular" viewers of your blog.

This LUA script is based on the great work of Giovanni Intini:
