wp-lighttpd-rewrite
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rewrite rules for a Wordpress 3.x installation on top of a lighttpd web server.

This LUA script comes in very handy if your using the following plugins in
your Wordpress installation:
  * wp-super-cache (http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-super-cache/)
  * WP-touch (http://bravenewcode.com/wptouch)
  
Usually, the mobile devices get the cached version of your Wordpress site served
instead of the WP-touch UI version. This script allows you to serve uncached 
files to mobile devices, search engine bots, etc. while serving cached (and 
possibly even compressed) content to "regular" viewers of your blog.

This LUA script is based on the great work of Giovanni Intini:
